<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent a tristique purus. Aenean lorem dui, pellentesque vel euismod in, egestas sit amet elit. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. In elementum, nulla ac malesuada tincidunt, massa urna pellentesque ante, eu molestie nunc dui in eros. Vestibulum sit amet efficitur est. Pellentesque ac rutrum tellus. Nulla mattis ex vitae elementum suscipit. Suspendisse sit amet auctor diam, ut consectetur turpis. Donec pellentesque, enim non dignissim commodo, dui neque lacinia velit, sit amet rutrum ex dolor et sem. Nam at vehicula lorem. Morbi scelerisque sapien vel dolor gravida, id eleifend tortor rutrum. Curabitur vel sagittis mi. Ut aliquam risus nunc, a consequat metus iaculis at. Pellentesque ligula quam, suscipit vitae neque sed, luctus congue ligula.</p>

<h3>The Situation</h3>

<p>What is it that makes a topic so popular? Who is the most popular celebrity? What is the most searched animal on Google? How has the popularity of the top 30 searches changed in the past 30 days? The application I am proposing would not answer these questions. The users of the application would answer them. The application I am creating will have a user interface similar to that of a stock simulator, with graphs of past performance, a portfolio, and a watchlist. This application would allow people to “bet” on the popularity rankings or buy “shares” of different popular Google search results. <br>
This application could help incentivise people to stay up-to-date on current events. This application could also help recovering gambling addicts. Another demographic that this application would target is those people that have and enjoy a stock simulator app. The desired interface of my application is very similar to the layout and graphs of those apps. This application would be more of a game, but it would be based on real treading searches on Google, just like how the stock simulators are based on real market trading activity. <br>
My client would actually be my business partner, and would help me develop, release, and market the application. My client would also have a hand in developing the application, although I will be doing most if not all of the programming. When I talked to my client during the “initial interaction,” my client liked the concept, and was talking over the details with me.
</p>

<h3>The Rationale</h3>

<p>I decided to create an app that provides statistics and other details relating to controversial topics, sorted by the position they support. I chose to work in Python, because of my personal familiarity with it, and for the Kivy resource to help develop the app for multiple platforms. Also, I may work on this project with the “client,” who is newish to programming, so I need a programming language that has a gentle learning curve.</p>
        
<h3>Criteria for Success</h3>
        
<ul>
  <li>It must let users submit topics, data, statistics, and/or other improvements.</li>
  <li>It must have full database capability.</li>
  <li>It must be fairly intuitive (test by giving to someone unfamiliar with app).</li>
  <li>It must separate data supporting “for” positions from “against” positions in each topic. Neutral positions?</li>
  <li>Unbiased mode? Where for every “for” position displayed there’s an “against” also displayed.</li>
  <li>Random topic? Brings up a random topic on unbiased mode.</li>
</ul>
