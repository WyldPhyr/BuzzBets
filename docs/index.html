Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. In elementum, nulla ac malesuada tincidunt, massa urna pellentesque ante, eu molestie nunc dui in eros. Vestibulum sit amet efficitur est. Pellentesque ac rutrum tellus. Nulla mattis ex vitae elementum suscipit. Suspendisse sit amet auctor diam, ut consectetur turpis. Donec pellentesque, enim non dignissim commodo, dui neque lacinia velit, sit amet rutrum ex dolor et sem. Nam at vehicula lorem. Morbi scelerisque sapien vel dolor gravida, id eleifend tortor rutrum. Curabitur vel sagittis mi. Ut aliquam risus nunc, a consequat metus iaculis at. Pellentesque ligula quam, suscipit vitae neque sed, luctus congue ligula.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Imagine that you are at a social gathering of some kind, you are talking, and laughing, and having a good time. All of a sudden you hear someone say that the ACLU is subverting the Constitution. Now you could just go in guns blazing, but no one likes that kind of debate. You could also research the topic, but that would take way too long. This app lets you quickly look at data supporting your position so you can show that person that the ACLU is actually _defending_ the Constitution. My end-users are people who want to explore a controversial topic in-depth. Right now most people are very one-sided in their beliefs because that is what they’re accustomed to; it’s the culture they grew up in. This app will also help those who do not want to form an opinion until they have heard both sides. Another demographic my app will assist are the argumentative folks out there that always need to be right. Currently, they are reduced to bluffing about data and statistics, but with this app, all the evidence they need will be at their fingertips, conveniently sorted by topic and which side it supports. The app I will create will need to be accessible to the general public (intuitive), yet detailed enough for enthusiastic debaters. My client would actually be my business partner, and would help me develop, release, and market the app..</p>

<h3>The Rationale</h3>

<p>I decided to create an app that provides statistics and other details relating to controversial topics, sorted by the position they support. I chose to work in Python, because of my personal familiarity with it, and for the Kivy resource to help develop the app for multiple platforms. Also, I may work on this project with the “client,” who is newish to programming, so I need a programming language that has a gentle learning curve.</p>
        
<h3>Criteria for Success</h3>
        
<ul>
  <li>It must let users submit topics, data, statistics, and/or other improvements.</li>
  <li>It must have full database capability.</li>
  <li>It must be fairly intuitive (test by giving to someone unfamiliar with app).</li>
  <li>It must separate data supporting “for” positions from “against” positions in each topic. Neutral positions?</li>
  <li>Unbiased mode? Where for every “for” position displayed there’s an “against” also displayed.</li>
  <li>Random topic? Brings up a random topic on unbiased mode.</li>
</ul>
